        <section class="career-goals">
            <div class="section-title"><h2>Career Goals</h2></div>
            <p>"Do what you love and love what you do". This is a motto I've stuck with for my whole life, and I firmly believe that I should do what I love to do. I am very interested in the medical field, and aspire to be a doctor one day. I have joined many activities such as the American Red Cross, medical internships, etc. I plan to take the Biomedical Science Course offered at Emerald High School.</p>

        <section class="strengths">
            <div class="section-title"><h2>Strengths and Qualities</h2></div>
            <p>I consider myself a very ambitious, hard-working, dedicated, and methodical person. This all adds to my meticulous personality, as I always strive for the best. This makes me persistent and always looking to achieve my goals. I believe that this is very beneficial for me to become a doctor because pursuing a career in the medical field requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and studying. My ambition will help me get through my tough times, and my independence and self-motivation will encourage me to study and work hard. I have shown this persistence in swimming, golf, and also art. I am persistent and I try want to get better at whatever activity I am doing.</p>

        <section class="achievements">
            <div class="section-title"><h2>Important Achievements</h2></div>
            <p>Some of my major accomplishments in high school are doing well academically, having a good report card with my grades. Not only this, but I was also part of the Emerald High School Girls Golf Team. Emerald has many clubs, and I am the Founding Vice-President of the first EHS club that was chartered; Model United Nations. I am also part of the EHS Debate Club, Scholastic Arts and Writing, TUPE, etc.</p>

        <section class="skills">
            <div class="section-title"><h2>Abilities and Work Skills</h2></div>
            <p>I think I have learned that a competitive environment really enables me to work to my fullest potential, and I learned this in school because Dublin has a fairly competitive academic environment, and it has only taught me to work harder and work faster. Not only this, but being on a sports team really has helped me learn discipline and dedication. Volunteering also taught me that service benefits everyone, and it also really helped me talk to people better and collaborate.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <div class="section-title"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
            <p>Overall I think that high school has really helped me grow, not only academically, but as a person and as a friend. Not only has it helped me work on my existing skills, it has helped me develop new ones. Thank you for your time, and please feel free to explore my site.</p>
